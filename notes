Streams -> way to read / write data from IO devices 
Input -> read
Output  -> write

Byte stream - binary data -> Stream classes 
Character Stream - character data -> Reader Writer classes


FileInput/FileOutput

DataInputStream
BufferedInputStream -> Temporary storage is maintained -> much faster -> 8kb

This is a good day -> string -> send it over a stream -> print on console 

Reader/Writer -> text data -> characters -> ascii code -> put onto stream
encoding/decoding -> utf8, utf16....-> 
unicode characters -> 


aa#aa -> converted to byte


Objects onto a file -> ?

Student { Object } -> sobj -> id,name,address -> file

ObjectInput/OutputStreams

Serialization/Marshalling
Deserialization/Unmarshalling
